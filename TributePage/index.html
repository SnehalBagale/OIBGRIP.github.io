              Swami Vivekananda
            </h1>  
<p>  
               Swami Vivekananda  born Narendranath Datta in 12 January 1863 was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.<br><br>  
                He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.<br><br>  
                Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the words, "Sisters and brothers of America...," before introducing Hinduism to Americans  He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as “an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West.<br><br>  
                Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his countrymen, and found a way to travel to the United States where he was highly successful. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission, to provide charity, social work and education Vivekananda was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India He is regarded as a patriotic saint, and his birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.  
                <br><br>
                <b>Education</b><br> In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877  In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination.<br><br> He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature,He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Narendra was trained in Indian classical music,and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution .   
                
                <br><br><b>Initial spiritual forays</b><br>In 1880, Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism.[45] Narendra became a member of a Freemasonry lodge "at some point before 1884"[46] and of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore.<br><br> From 1881 to 1884, he was also active in Sen's Band of Hope, which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking.It was in this cultic  milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western esotericism. His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which denounced polytheism and caste restrictions,and a "streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta."Rammohan Roy, the founder of the Brahmo Samaj who was strongly influenced by unitarianism, strove towards a universalistic interpretation of Hinduism. His ideas were "alter econsiderably" by Debendranath Tagore, who had a romantic approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the Vedas.
                <br><br><b>Meeting with Ramakrishna</b><br>Vivekananda met Ramakrishna in late 1881 or early 1882. He initially did not accept Ramakrishna’s ideas or philosophy, but began to visit the monk frequently and hold discussions with him.In 1884, Vivekananda’s family suffered a sudden reversal of fortune when his father died. It was then that Vivekananda found solace in Ramakrishna’s teachings and eventually accepted him as his guru. Vivekananda received saffron robes from Ramakrishna in 1885, before the guru died of throat cancer.
                In 1888, Vivekananda began a tour of India as a ‘wandering monk’, living on bhiksha or donations and trying to discover the country by talking to common folk.  
                <br><br><b>The Chicago speech</b> Vivekananda delivered his now famous Chicago speech at the Parliament of the World’s Religions which was held in 1893 from September 11 to 27 at the Art Institute of Chicago.
                <br>
                His speech, which began with, “Sisters and brothers of America”, got him a standing ovation at the summit. In his speech, Vivekananda touched upon the fact that though people may follow different religions, yet all paths eventually lead to god.  
                <br><br> <b>Founding of Ramakrishna Math</b><br>In 1897, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Ashram. In 1899, he established the Belur Math/monastery on the West Bank of the Ganges, which became an important centre for the teaching of the philosophy and principles associated with Vedanta.  
                <br><br><b>Death</b><br> Swami Vivekananda died on July 4, 1902. He was meditating at Belur math when a ruptured blood vessel in his brain led to his death. His followers believe that the rupture was due to brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi.  
                <br><br><b>Vivekananda’s writing and speeches</b><br>He wrote four classics, Jnana-Yoga, Bhakti-Yoga, Karma-Yoga, and Raja-Yoga, which are his treatises on Hindu philosophy and the teachings of Vedanta. In addition, his ideas and philosophy come through in the many lectures he delivered, the letters he wrote to friends and disciples, poems and songs composed by him.  
                <br><br><b>Vivekananda’s influence</b><br> Vivekananda’s writings and teachings had an impact on many of India’s nationalist leaders, who were fighting against the colonial rule. Subhas Chandra Bose called Vivekananda “the maker of modern India” and Mahatma Gandhi credited Vivekananda’s with increasing his “love for his country a thousandfold”.
